1. Simple Subqueries:

A simple subquery is a query that can be executed independently of the outer query. It provides a single value or a set of values that the outer
query can use for comparison or filtering. Simple subqueries can be used in various clauses, such as SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING.

 example:
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name= 'Sales');



2. Correlated Subqueries:

A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on the outer query for its execution. Unlike simple subqueries, 
correlated subqueries are executed once for each row processed by the outer query. They are often used to perform row-by-row comparisons or calculations.

example :
SELECT product_name
FROM products p
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products WHERE category_id = p.category_id);
